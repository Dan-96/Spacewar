Pygame project heavily inspired by the game "Spacewar!" from 1962.

My main focus in this project is to further broaden my Python and Github knowledge,                
as well as any other libraries and frameworks that I'll use along the way depending on what I'll see fit.

The goal is to loosely remake the original Spacewar! game and enhance it with additional features                   
e.g. main menu, different weapons, health system, etc.
